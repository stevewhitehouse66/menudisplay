# Menu Display System Project

## About & Why
I've recently noticed that a lot of takeaways run a  menu system, based on static images or looped video displayed on a smart TV. 
However the menu is supplied on a usb stick and has to be redone by the supplier whenever a menu or price change is made.

This system is flexible, uses a template system, is extensible to many screens and uses live data. Each page of the dsplayed data may be displayed in the Browser App on a different smart TV, or cycled through on the same SmartTV.
Shop owner may set up the menu system to their own rquirements via owner interface or the system can be configured and updated on their behalf. (MAAS)
